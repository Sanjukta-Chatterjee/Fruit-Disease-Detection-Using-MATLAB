# Fruit-Disease-Detection-Using-MATLAB

Fruit Disease Detection using MATLAB involves using image processing and machine learning to identify and classify diseases in fruits. The process starts with capturing or importing fruit images, followed by preprocessing to enhance the images. Key features such as color, texture, and shape are extracted, which are then used to train a machine learning model to detect and classify diseases. This approach helps in early identification of infected fruits, improving crop quality and reducing losses.
